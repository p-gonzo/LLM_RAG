Then, head over to the well in the central room and hop in. Follow the tunnel until you reach the chest at the end, which contains a small key. Climb out of the well and exit the West Courtyard to return to the central room. Alternatively, you can go to an underground grotto under a tree near the Hyrule Castle Moat by playing the Song of Storms, then hop down. Bomb the walls until you find the golden skulltula. Kill it but don't take the token yet. Instead, stand right in front of the circle of light leading back up to the surface, lock onto the token with Z-Targeting, throw the boomerang at it, and immediately do a back flip into the light. The boomernang should return right as you return to the surface, allowing you to keep the token while leaving the skulltula down there. You can repeat this process to get multiple golden tokens. However, be aware that this method is considered cheating by some players."
