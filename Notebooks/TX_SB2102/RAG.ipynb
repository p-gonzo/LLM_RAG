It included provisions for a three-year emissions inspection period for certain vehicles, authorization for fees, and submission of revisions to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for approval by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for commercial fleet buyers. The bill also required that fees collected were to provide the same revenue as if the vehicle was inspected annually or biennially, and added a new section to Chapter 502, Transportation Code, regarding vehicle inspection and maintenance programs approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under Section 548.301 and the Clean Air Act.\n",

The fees for motor vehicle inspections are set at $12.50 for non-mopeds and $5.75 for mopeds, as specified in Section 6 of the bill. However, Section 2 amends Sections 382.202 and 548.5035 of the Transportation Code, which will result in an additional $2 fee per registration period for vehicle inspections. Additionally, Section 185 of the federal Clean Air Act requires certain fees to be collected, and these fees are not specified in the text provided.
