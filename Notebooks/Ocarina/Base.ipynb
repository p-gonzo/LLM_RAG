      "The most difficult part of the game for me is probably the exploration and puzzle solving aspect. I find it challenging to figure out where I need to go next, and how to get there. The puzzles can also be quite tricky at times, and require a lot of trial and error to solve. Additionally, the game's world is quite large and open-ended, which can make it difficult to know what to do next or where to focus your efforts. Overall, I would say that the exploration and puzzle solving aspect of the game is the most challenging for me, but also the most rewarding when I am able to overcome a particularly difficult challenge."

In the Temple of Time, there is a painting depicting Princess Zelda with several other princesses, one of whom looks very similar to Peach. This is likely an intentional homage to Mario and his relationship with Peach. So although Link doesn't meet them in person in Ocarina of Time, the game does make a reference to them."
