It is often described as the number of ways in which a system's energy can be arranged, with a higher entropy indicating more possible configurations and thus greater disorder. In statistical terms, entropy is proportional to the logarithm of the number of microstates that correspond to a given macrostate. Entropy plays a central role in our understanding of thermodynamic processes, such as heat transfer and the irreversibility of natural phenomena.\u001b[0m\n",
