      "Sure thing! So, there's a law called SB2588. It's like a set of rules that the grown-ups made for something called a Municipal Utility District in Fort Bend County. This district is responsible for building and taking care of roads and drainage systems, but they need permission from the cities or towns where the roads are located. The law also says that the district can collect money from people who live in the area to help pay for these projects. And there's another law called SB2102 that talks about cars getting inspected every year or two to make sure they don't pollute too much. The grown-ups have made sure all the rules were followed before this law could be passed. That's it! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n",

      "Okay, imagine there's a rule that says some cars in Texas need to have their emissions checked every year or every two years. But now, there's a new rule that says some cars can have their emissions checked every three years instead. This rule is part of a bigger plan called SB2102. The plan also says how the state should collect fees for these emissions checks to make sure they get the same amount of money as before. And if the big plan requires it, the state must set up this system. But, even if this new rule applies, cars still need to pass an emissions check if there's a federal or state law that says so. And some cars, like rental cars, have different rules.\n",
